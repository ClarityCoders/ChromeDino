# Create a bot using only image Processing. 
- Code uses image processing and rules to play the Chrome Dino Game.
- The location of the pixels will need to be updated in this file in order for it to work on your system.
- This is a simple example showing how complicated a system like this can get even on a simple game.
- Please check out the video if you need any extra help! 

## Setup
- Take screen shot and update the region the bot should see in CreateData.py
- Then run CreateData.py it will create files in the img folder while you manually play the game.
- Use the images in a program like pain to locate the values of the enemies.
- Update pixel locations and the screenshot region in RunEpisodes.py
- RunEpisodes.py will also create a stat file for you while it runs episodes.
